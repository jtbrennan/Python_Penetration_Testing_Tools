# Python for Penetration Testing

FreeCodeCamp's video courses teach you penetration testing with Python. Also known as a pen test, penetration testing is a simulated attack against a system to check for vulnerabilities.

In the FreeCodeCamp course, you'll learn about sockets, create a TCP server and client, build an Nmap scanner, and other tools and techniques that pen testers use daily.
